DASC5410 Data and Database Management

Objective:
This assignment focuses on secure management of sensitive data, particularly password handling, using hashing functions and salting in an Oracle database environment.

Key Elements:
1. Hashing Functions**: Use of SHA-256 for converting passwords into fixed-length, irreversible hashes.
2. Salt: Enhancement of security by adding a random sequence to passwords before hashing.
3. Oracle DBMS and DBMS_CRYPTO Package**: Application of Oracle's cryptographic functions for secure data handling.

Tasks Overview:
- Task 1: Design logical and physical models for a user authentication system, ensuring proper data type settings for hashed passwords.
- Task 2: Develop SQL DDL scripts for creating user-related tables with detailed comments and proper Oracle data types.
- Task 3: Implement PL/SQL procedures and functions for user addition, authentication, and secure data retrieval based on password validity.

Learning Outcomes:
Participants will gain practical skills in secure database management using advanced SQL and PL/SQL, understanding the importance of hashing and salting for password security.

Disclaimer:
The techniques used are for educational purposes and may not suffice for full security measures in a production environment. Further exploration of Oracle's security features is advised for comprehensive implementations.
